    (1) Read timeouts raise an exception rather than just returning less

    (2) A blocking read() or read_until() command will not lose any data
    already read if a timeout or KeyboardInterrupt occurs during the read.
    Instead, the next time the read function is called, the data already
    read in will still be there.
    (3) A read_until() command is provided that reads from the serial port
    until some string is matched.
