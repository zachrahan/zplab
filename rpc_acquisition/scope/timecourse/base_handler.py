                only if additional data needs to be read in or out during
                acquisition. (E.g. a background model or similar.)
            position_metadata: list of all the stored position metadata from the
                previous timepoints, in chronological order. In particular, this
                dictionary is guaranteed to contain 'timestamp' which is the

                (such as the latest focal plane) stored by previous acquisition
